   Follow on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

## Instructions

### Homebrew

I leverage Homebrew to automate the download and update process for commonly
used applications.

#### Install

Follow these commands to install all packages listed in the Brewfile (incl. the
patched Caskaydia Cove nerd font that I use in my setup):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
cd ~/dotfiles/.config/homebrew
brew bundle install
```

#### Update

To update, run:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/.config/homebrew
brew bundle --verbose
brew cleanup --verbose
brew doctor --verbose
```

#### Cleanup

Remove Homebrew dependencies not listed in the Brewfile:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/.config/homebrew
brew bundle --force cleanup
```

#### Reinstall

Reinstall Homebrew dependencies from the Brewfile:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/.config/homebrew
brew uninstall --force $(brew list)
brew autoremove
brew bundle install
```

### Stow

Use Stow to create symlinks for the configs inside the dotfiles folder. Resolve
conflicts by removing `.zsh`-related files from your root folder:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
find . -name ".DS_Store" -delete
stow . -v
```

### Ghostty

Ensure that Ghostty, my terminal of choice, is working and configured.

### GitHub CLI

Authenticate with a [GitHub instance](https://cli.github.com/manual/):

```bash
gh auth login
```

### mise

Ensure the right tool versions with [mise-en-place](https://github.com/jdx/mise).

### Raycast

Disable Spotlight search hotkey and set it as the [default hotkey for Raycast](https://manual.raycast.com/hotkey).

### Ni

Detect the relevant package manager to use with
[ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) based on the lockfiles in your project. This
tool also provides an usefull shorthand (e.g. `pnpm run` => `nr`).

```bash
npm i -g @antfu/ni
```
